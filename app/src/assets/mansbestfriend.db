That said, you can count on them to alert their owners to danger (Look! The UPS guy is coming!). They enjoy daily walks or brief outdoor romps, but because of their short noses, they shouldn’t be exercised on hot, humid days and should have access to cool (preferably air-conditioned) rooms during the warmer months. Besides snoozing the day away, the Frenchie’s favorite hobby is being his owner’s personal lap warmer.','Routine grooming for the French Bulldog includes regular nail trimming, ear cleaning, brushing to remove excess hair, frequent cleansing of skin folds, and occasional bathing. Their fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their bat ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection.

Your vet should do regular dental checkups and care, and you should clean your dog’s teeth regularly at home as well. As a short-faced, brachycephalic, dwarf breed, French Bulldogs may have some health concerns that you should be aware of. The short face can make their breathing less efficient than that of long-nosed breeds, so Frenchies have less tolerance of heat, exercise, and stress, all of which increase their need to breathe. Keep your French Bulldog cool in warm weather, and avoid strenuous exercise. If your dog seems to overheat or become stressed too easily, with noisy breathing and sometimes spitting up foam, consult the vet and have its airway evaluated for pinched nostrils or an elongated soft palate. Anesthesia is also more risky in short-faced dogs, so be sure your veterinarian is experienced with such breeds should your Frenchie need to be anesthetized. The spine also merits special attention. Like other dwarf breeds, the stocky French Bulldog may also have abnormal vertebrae and/or premature degeneration of the intervertebral discs. While the spine is supported by good musculature, herniation of degenerated discs can cause major problems, and most symptomatic back problems are due to disc disease rather than to abnormal vertebrae.');

For this reason, and many others, Rottweilers do not thrive in a kennel environment. Although a fenced yard is a must for the dog to safely experience some freedom of movement, no Rottweiler should spend all its time alone, banished from the family. Rottweilers are ‘people’ dogs.

Unlike humans, your Collie does not need presentation nor food dyes to stimulate its appetite. When selecting a food, rely on a recommendation from its breeder and become a label reader. Look for high quality, digestible, meat-based protein as close to the top of the list as possible. Avoid foods requiring even a 75 pound adult Collie of average activity level to consume 5-7 cups of food a day. Be wary of unnecessary fillers. Dogs are basically carnivores. They do not nutritionally require carbohydrates nor grains to sustain health or life; they don’t need corn, wheat or gluten.

Simple routine grooming includes brushing, nail trimming, bathing, and teeth and ear cleaning. Actual coat care depends upon the amount of coat a dog carries and the time of year. Brush a Collie using a pin brush. Hold it at an angle to the skin and “back” brush from head to tail in the opposite direction from which hair grows. Then brush with the growth to smooth it out. Collies in full coat should be brushed once every week or two. Hair behind the ears of a rough may mat easily, so remember to brush there. Trim hair between the foot pads so it does not become matted. A dog that is out of coat or in &amp;quot;summer coat&amp;quot; requires less grooming. Smooth Collies have a short dense coat requiring less brushing proportionately. Both varieties shed. The Collie is generally clean and odor-free. When requiring a bath, use only shampoo intended for dogs. Human products can cause dry, flaky, irritated skin. Always rinse until the water runs clean; towel or blow dry thoroughly. Nails should neither protrude over the pad nor touch the ground when standing. Clicking nails when your Collie walks also indicates a nail trim. Trim at an angle about 2mm away from the quick. Trim the dew claw hidden in the rough coat. When needed use a cotton ball moistened in rubbing alcohol to gently clean the inside ear flap. A quality knuckle bone or weekly brushing keep teeth healthy.','The Collie is a healthy, sturdy breed with an average life expectancy of 12 years. Quality food, regular exercise, routine grooming and an annual health exam will help keep your Collie in peak health. Your Collie’s annual health check-up should include parasite control, dental exam, heartworm screening, and every third year a distemper/parvo vaccine. Rabies vaccine needs to be administered every one to three years depending on state laws.	All Collies should have a preliminary eye check by a registered canine ophthalmologist to test for Collie Eye Anomaly. Examined dogs have a certificate from the eye specialist describing that dog’s vision. While PRA, progressive retinal atrophy, is quite uncommon today; genetic testing clears parents. Speak with you breeder for more information. Some Collies are sensitive to certain drugs, such as Ivermectin, found in some heartworm preventatives, and also some over-the-counter drugs like Imodium. Always consult your vet before administering drugs to your dog. For more information about drug sensitivity in Collies, visit Washington State University’s website: www.vetmed.wsu.edu/depts-VCPL.
